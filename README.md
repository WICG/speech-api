# Web Speech API

This is the source for the [Web Speech API](https://w3c.github.io/speech-api/) spec.

## Tests

For normative changes, a corresponding
[web-platform-tests](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests) PR is highly appreciated. Typically,
both PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the spec should
not be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please explain why
and if appropriate [file a web-platform-tests issue](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/new)
to follow up later. Add the `type:untestable` or `type:missing-coverage` label as appropriate.
